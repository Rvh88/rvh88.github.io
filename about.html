<h2>Who am I </h2>
<p> I am a researcher at Lancaster University. I conduct behavioural experiments, prepare and analyse participant data, and report results through journal publications, posters and presentations.</p>

<h2>  </h2>
<p> My research focuses primarily on using state of the art computational methods to explain human behaviour. It brings together the two things I find endlessly fascinating: human behaviour and technology. </p>

<p class="mb-5">During my masters at Tilburg University, I first got the opportunity to explore how cutting-edge technology (e.g., virtual reality, automated social signal processing, machine learning) can be used to explore human behaviour and the nature of our thoughts. In particular, I became fascinated by conceptual representation: how is it we know what we know? What is the stuff that thoughts are made off? </p>

<p> During my time at Lancaster University, I have had the chance to learn about our current ideas about the answer to this question. Along the way, I have learned about the way in which concepts are grounded in our sensory, affective and bodily experience. Furthermore, I also have gained a greater understanding in the role language plays in this </p>

<p> Along the way, I have gathered experience in statistical data analysis using linear and logistic mixed effects model. I have worked with R (tidyverse, ggplot2, lme4) and Python (numpy, Pandas, seaborn) on a range of behavioural datasets. </p>
