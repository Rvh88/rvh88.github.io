## The basic-level advantage in categorisation
If you haven't attended a lecture on concepts and categorisation (slim chance, I know), you may never have heard of the basic-level advantage in object categorisation. First demonstrated by Eleanor Rosch and colleagues (1976), the basic-level advantage (B.L.A.) broadly refers to people's preference for grouping objects together under labels of intermediate abstraction, dubbed basic-level categories. 

To illustrate what this means, let's imagine you spent a lovely day in the zoo (one with plenty of space for the animals to roam). A couple days later, you meet a friend for coffee and, being the polite kind of friend, they ask about your trip. Now you have a couple of options to describe the things you saw in the zoo. You could say: 

"It was great fun, I saw a ton of living things". 

While this would be a true statement, your friend would probably not find it very informative. Another option would be to say: 

"It was great fun, I saw an ocelot and a lynx, some cichlids, a blue discus, a pair of quetzals and a very dangerous looking cassowary." 

Here, your friends eyes might glaze over for another reason, what on earth are you talking about? However, much like for goldilocks, there is a third option inbetween that is just right: 

"It was great fun, I saw some big cats, a lot of fish and some beautiful birds".

The above example is meant to illustrate two things: 

- a single object (for example, a quetzal), may simultaneously belong to multiple categories (for example, a quetzal is a living thing, an animal, a bird, a quetzal etc.). 
- while any of these categories correctly describe the quetzal, we generally prefer to say it's a bird. 

## But why? 
The preference for the basic level is echoed in human behaviour in various ways. For example, people are faster and more accurate at categorising images of birds when they are preceded by the label 'bird' than they are when it is preceded by the more abstract 'animal' or the more specific 'quetzal'. Or, when asked to name a picture of a quetzal, people are more likely to say 'bird' than any other label.
